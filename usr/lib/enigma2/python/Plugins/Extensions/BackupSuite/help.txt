### **Technical Notes**

* **HDD backups**: Stored in `/media/hdd/backup`
* **USB backups**: Require FAT32-formatted drive with `backupstick` file
* **NET backups**: Require mounted CIFS/NFS share with write permissions
* **Restore**: Works from HDD, USB, NET or MMC storage
* Always choose **"Standard (root and kernel)"** when restoring

### **Troubleshooting NET Backup**

* Ensure NAS is powered on and accessible
* Verify username/password are correct
* Check share permissions (read/write)
* Test connection with `ping` command
* Use IP address instead of hostname if DNS fails
